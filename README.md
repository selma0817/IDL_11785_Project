### This is a Repo for our Convolutional Visiton Transformer (CvT) derived project for 11785 DL Class

# Introduction
Our goal is to improve  CvT for classification problem to improve accuracy of classification task on MC-COCO dataset
# Innovation 
1. Multi-Scale Feature Extraction
2. Enhance positional Encoding and Embeddings
3. Deformable convolution and attention
4. Convolutional Self-attention
## Baseline
CvT
## Evaluation Metrics: 
1. FLOPs
2. Accuracy
3. Param size 
___
## setup

## Step 2: dataset
Run download_coco.sh to download the COCO dataset.

## Step 2: models
HRNet:
Run download_HRNet.sh
